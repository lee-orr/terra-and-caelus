# Terra and Caelus

## Design

Procedural puzzles around manipulating plant growth via powers that transform the land or air.

### Puzzle Goals

- Get a certain plant to grow in 1 or more locations
- Remove a certain plant (or all plants) from 1 or more locations
- Reach a location

### Mechanics

- Player is localized with a top-down view of the world
- Player movement is limited
  - mostly to cells containing plant growth
  - unlockable powers may include teleportation, travel through water/air, etc.
- Limited available actions in each puzzle
- Unlock actions by completing an associated sub-goal
  - "temples" contain gifts of the gods - additional powers
- Different plants spread differently, and affect the terrain differently
